If you need a comment to explain what a block of code does, try Extract Function (106). 

If the method is already extracted but you still need a comment to explain what it does, use Change Function Declaration (124) to rename it. 

If you need to state some rules about the required state of the system, use Introduce Assertion (302).


A good time to use a comment is when you don’t know what to do. In addition to describing what is going on, comments can indicate areas in which you aren’t sure. A comment can also explain why you did something. This kind of information helps future modifiers, especially forgetful ones.
